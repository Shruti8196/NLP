Casuarius is a genus of birds in the order Casuariiformes, whose members are the cassowaries . The other two species are represented by the northern cassowary and the dwarf cassowary. The taxonomic name   papuanus also may be in need of revision to Casuarius  westermanni. A fossil species was reported from Australia, but for reasons of biogeography, this assignment is not certain, and it might belong to the prehistoric Emuarius, which was a genus of cassowary-like primitive emus. Typically, all cassowaries are shy birds that are found in the deep forest. They are adept at disappearing long before a human knows they were there. The casque's shape and size, up to 18cm , is species-dependent. Earlier research indicates the birds lower their heads when running "full tilt through the vegetation, brushing saplings aside and occasionally careening into small trees. Cassowaries eat fallen fruit, and consequently spend much time under trees where seeds the size of golfballs or larger fall from heights up to 30m ; the wedge-shaped casque may protect the head by deflecting falling fruit.[citation needed
The casques also may play a role in either sound reception or acoustic communication. The male cassowary defends a territory of about 7km2  for himself. The female pursues him into the water, where he eventually drives her to the shallows, where she crouches making ritualistic motions of her head. In some cases, another male may approach and run off the first male.
