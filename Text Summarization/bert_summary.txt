Casuarius is a genus of birds in the order Casuariiformes, whose members are the cassowaries . Three species are extant: The most common, the southern cassowary, is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the ostrich and emu. The genus Casuarius was erected by French scientist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his Ornithologie published in 1760. The evolutionary history of cassowaries, as of all ratites, is not well known. Studies show that ratites continued to evolve after this separation into their modern counterparts. Females are larger and more brightly coloured than the males. All three species have a keratinous, skin-covered casque on their heads that grows with age. The casque would help protect the skull from such collisions". Cassowaries eat fallen fruit, and consequently spend much time under trees where seeds the size of golfballs or larger fall from heights up to 30m ; the wedge-shaped casque may protect the head by deflecting falling fruit.[citation needed
The casques also may play a role in either sound reception or acoustic communication. This is related to a discovery that at least the dwarf cassowary and southern cassowary produce very-low-frequency sounds, which may aid in communication in dense rainforest. The male cassowary defends a territory of about 7km2  for himself. The two may remain in copulation for extended periods of time.
