Recurrent Neural Networks, on the other hand, are a bit complicated. The data travels in cycles through different layers.\n",

Chatbots are fast and easy to access, and chatbots can be good sources of information if trained that way. A study also found that people felt it was important for chatbots to be humanlike, because they would want the chatbots to provide emotional support."
